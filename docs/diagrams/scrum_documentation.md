# 📌 Scrum Documentation

## 🎯 Project Overview
The project focuses on predictive modeling of EUR/USD price range variations based on economic news sentiment analysis. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that forecasts price movements using historical forex price data and sentiment indicators extracted from financial news.

## 🔥 Scrum Framework Implementation
### 🏗️ Roles & Responsibilities
- **Product Owner:** Defines project goals and prioritizes the backlog.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process and removes impediments.
- **Development Team:** Implements machine learning models, processes data, and ensures deployment.

### 📝 Sprint Planning
Sprints are planned in **2-week cycles**, with clear deliverables defined in each sprint.

#### Sprint 1: Data Collection & Cleaning
- Gather historical forex price data.
- Collect economic news articles.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.

#### Sprint 2: Feature Engineering & Sentiment Analysis
- Extract relevant technical indicators from forex data.
- Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis on financial news.

#### Sprint 3: Model Selection & Training
- Train baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, etc.).
- Optimize hyperparameters and evaluate models.

#### Sprint 4: Model Evaluation & Visualization
- Compare model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R-Squared.
- Create visualization tools for insights.

#### Sprint 5: Deployment & Documentation
- Deploy the trained model using Flask/FastAPI.
- Write final documentation and project reports.

### 📊 Scrum Events
1. **Daily Standup Meetings:** Quick updates on progress, blockers, and next steps.
2. **Sprint Review:** Presentation of sprint deliverables and stakeholder feedback.
3. **Sprint Retrospective:** Discuss improvements for the next sprint.
