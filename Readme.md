# Predictive Modeling of EUR/USD Price Variations

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predictive modeling of price range variations in the EUR/USD forex market based on economic news sentiment analysis. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of forecasting price movements based on historical price data and sentiment indicators extracted from financial news.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for forex price data.
- Implementation of sentiment analysis on economic news.
- Application of machine learning and deep learning models to predict price variations.
- Model evaluation and performance analysis.
- Visualization of results and insights.
